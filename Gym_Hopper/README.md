# Gym Hopper Videos

In the `videos/` folder, you can find two demonstration videos of the Gym Hopper environment, both slowed down to **0.25x** speed:

- **`Gym_hopper_NO_UDR.mp4`**: Shows the result **without Uniform Domain Randomization (UDR)**.
- **`Gym_hopper_UDR.mp4`**: Shows the result **with Uniform Domain Randomization (UDR)**.

These videos illustrate the difference in performance and robustness between training with and without UDR.
